# Homework-4



## Description
In this project I was tasked with building a quiz from scratch and using javascript to move the user throught the questions


## Takeaways
This project was very difficult and I had to restart a couple of times. I eventually was able to find a way to navigate the user through the  quiz and show the appropriate question and the total correct answers at the end.
